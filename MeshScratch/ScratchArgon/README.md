# ScratchArgon
# Project to play around with Argon device as gateway to create temperature and himidity sensing network with other Particle Mesh devices.

# At some point this code will be codified in a "production" respository, but I need to figure out what the best architecture looks like, 
# especially as it relates to sharing code between devices. It would be nice to have a lot of "base" code that can be compiled and pushed to 
# all of my devices - how to do that ermains to be seen
